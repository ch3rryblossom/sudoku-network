## Chaos in “Sudoku” Neuronal Networks with Balanced Excitatory and Inhibitory Activity

We know that in random network populations, learning leads us to a balanced state of excitation and inhibition. The resulting network dynamics are chaotic. 
The project shall investigate the route to chaos as transitions between different states/dynamics: (fixed points, limit cycles, transitions between limit cycles) using "Sudoku" networks modelled with excitation-inhibition balance following the characteristic networks of Vogels et al., 2011.
